# mod_catpointer_articles

Module created for [J and Beyond 2018](https://jandbeyond.org/) to demonstrate usage of TDD and Twig in Joomla! extensions.  

This module aims to someday replace the different `mod_articles_****` joomla modules with an unique module to render articles.  

**There is no stable release. For now this is a playground.**
